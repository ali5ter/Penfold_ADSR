# Penfold_ADSR
[KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) project for the circuit and PCB of R.A. Penfolds ADSR design which I adapted as a Eurorack powered module.
The original circuit is taken from [the book, "Electronic Synthesiser Construction" by R. A. Penfold](https://sdiy.info/wiki/Penfold_synthesiser), published by Babani in 1986.

I have kept to the original design as much as possible but added power and switched INT.Gate via [a Eurorack spec bus](https://doepfer.de/home_e.htm).

I have yet to manufacture and test this circuit.
